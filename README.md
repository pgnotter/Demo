# Stock Market Prediction Game

Static web app that uses real market data from Alpha Vantage to power a simple up/down prediction game. Built for deployment on GitHub Pages.

## Features

- Enter any valid stock ticker (e.g., `MSFT`, `COF`).
- Fetches real daily adjusted prices from Alpha Vantage.
- Randomly selects a starting trading day between 7 and 100 days ago (non-holiday/weekday).
- Shows the previous 7 trading days plus the starting day on a line chart.
- Predict up/down beginning the next trading day; score +1 for correct predictions.
- After each guess, the next day is revealed, the chart and current date advance, and score updates.

## Local Development

This is a static site; open `index.html` in a browser. For best results, serve via a local web server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000/
```
